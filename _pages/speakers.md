# Speakers

# Monday 19th June - Launch Event

## Cristin Merrit
*Chief Marketing Officer, Alces Flight*

### Sustainable High Performance Computing (HPC) through Open-Source

HPC is one of the most time, cost, and energy intensive forms of computing today.  However, it is also one that is rising rapidly in popularity thanks to the progress being made in the speed and ease of collection of computational data.  With the advent of new technologies such as AI and ML being regularly utilised in the HPC, the question becomes this: How can we sustain positive momentum in HPC and not cause more problems than we can solve?  Cristin Merritt, CMO of Alces Flight, will walk through how York’s partnership with Alces addresses sustainability - and how the OpenFlightHPC open-source project facilitates an economy of scale within the Viking HPC Cluster, enabling the team to look holistically at solving many of the complex challenges that dominate the supercomputing space.

# Wednesday 21st June - ONLINE

## The Role of Wikidata Within the Research Lifecycle
*White Rose Libraries, ONLINE event.*

This is a White Rose Libraries co-hosted event at the University of York library based around advocacy for the use of Wikidata within the research lifecycle. We are bringing together researchers and professionals from across the three institutions and Wikimedia UK to showcase the use of Wikidata, a free linked database of secondary data that can be read and edited by both humans and machines, in their research. The event will start with a presentation from Martin Poulter, a trainer and adviser to academics, librarians, and other experts on how to work with open projects such as Wikidata and Wikipedia. He will be addressing the strengths of Wikidata for Digital Humanities. We will also be hosting two members of Wikimedia UK: Dr. Richard Nevell, Programme Manager and Connected Heritage Programme Lead, and Dr. Lucy Hinnie, Digital Skills Wikimedian. Dr Fran Allfrey, Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Archaeology, University of York, will be talking to us about Medieval Wiki: learnings from editing wikidata with medieval scholars. The Medieval Wiki project page is [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_MedievalWiki) Finally, Ruth Elder, Collections Management Spcialist at the University of York, will give us an insight into the collaborative work with adding information to Wikidata from their respective university libraries’s theses repository.

### Machine-learned Acceleration for Molecular Dynamics Calculations

I will discuss our experience to date using on-the-fly fitting and evaluation of a Machine Learning interatomic potential, as a way of significantly accelerating first principles molecular dynamics calculations of materials, without loss of accuracy compared to the underlying first principles method. This is in contrast to the more established approach of carefully fitting an ML potential to a wide body of data calculated using a first principles method, and then using that in a calculation of the dynamics.

### Towards a Data Commons in Language Research

Colleagues in the life sciences have accelerated and democratised research by creating  interactive, community-governed software platforms that enable the integration, reuse and analysis of large-scale data. Could the language learning research community achieve something similar? In this talk I’ll report the findings from an ongoing evaluation of the FAIR-ness, completeness and reusability of datasets that have been archived in the IRIS (Instruments and data for research in language studies) repository with a view to identifying challenges and opportunities ahead.
